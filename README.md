# CS499Assignment1
First github assignment of CS499
The Food Tracking folder is the top level of a Visual Studio project.
I have not maintained it since stopped working on it over the summer of 2018. There does appear to be a small compilation issue that arises when it is converted to run with the new Visual Studio, but it does still run.
The only issue I found in it's running is when the user displays the food database. The foods are supposed to display starting at the far left edge of the window and wrap when they reach the end. It appears that now it starts 3 tabs out and so the format doesn't wrap properly.
